                <h1>Intro to Theory</h1>

		<p>Untold hours go into debating and learning theories. Schools are filled with students memorizing models, and debating diagrams, all in an attempt to make sense of the world. Even apart from academia, bookstores are filled with volumes proposing various theories for the everyday learner. The sheer amount of effort spent developing and learning theories before even applying them should give us pause. What is all this knowledge-work for? What does theory do for us, especially in the field of HCI?</p>

<p>In our final reading for HCDE 501, Halverson posited a four-fold purpose for theories; they must be descriptive, rhetorical, inferential, and applicable. She is not alone in questioning the role of theory. Thomas Kuhn in his landmark The Structure of Scientific Revolutions explains the need for paradigmatic theories to guide inquiry. Theories, in their explanation of the world guide science in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Theories determine what problems people in a specific field should attempt to solve</li>
<li>Theories propose ways to go about solving those problems</li>
</ul>


<h1>About this page</h1>

                <h1>Cognitive Science</h1>
		
		<p>In the early years, HCI was mainly influenced by psychology. In the first half of the 20th century, behaviorism was the dominant paradigm in psychology, which was primarily interested in analyzing human behavior. The cognitive revolution of the 1950s eventually supplanted behaviorism - the cognitive psychology perspective was more interested in different aspects of mental processing: memory, perception, language processing, problem solving, attention, learning, and performance. This logical perspective guided HCI until the post-cognitivist revolution struck in the mid 1990s.</p>
	
		<h2>Major Tenets</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Human cognition is essentially information processing, similar to digital computing</li>
		<li>Human minds contain representations of the outside world</li>
		<li>Emphasize controlled experiments in a laboratory setting</li>
		<li>Focus on individuals over groups, culture or social context</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Cognitive science offers a science of measurable metrics</li>
		<li>Cognitive science accurately predicts things such as response time and the time for visual search</li>
		<li>Cognitive science does not account for cultural or social factors</li>
		<li>Cognitive science ignores parts of cognition when it models the human brain like a computer</li>

                <h1>Distributed Cognition</h1>
		
		<p>Distributed Cognition or DCog utilizes the methods and theories of Cognitive Science but expands the unit of analysis to include cognitive process outside of the individual to include whole systems. DCog posits that cognition can be distributed across numerous individuals, artifacts, environments, and even time. It also states that cognition is situated in a sociocultural context that has a deep impact on the system as a whole. The understanding of this context is crucial as DCog considers this context as indistinguishable from the cognitive system as a whole. Essentially, DCog is not limited to the processes occurring within the brain.</p>

		<h2>Major Tenets</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Socio-cultural context is critical</li>
		<li>Cognition is not limited to the human brain</li>
		<li>Cognition occurs across groups, tools, and time</li>
		<li>Humans and non-humans are symmetric in a cognitive network</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Broad and expanded cognitive viewpoint is ideal for collaborative work</li>
		<li>Stresses the relationship between culture and technology</li>
		<li>Reliance on ethnographic research may be too time consuming for many applications</li>
		<li>Lacks a rigid language and naming structure for analysis</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The main figure of DCog, and in fact its creator is <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hutchins">Edwin Hutchins</a></strong>. Hutchins is known as the father of DCog and proposed the theory after performing extensive ethnographic studies of naval activity such as ship navigation and docking procedures. Hutchins background is initially in anthropology, however he slowly shifted to cognitive science through the usage of cognitive ethnography and involvement with HCI.
The seminal publication of DCog is Hutchins’s book Cognition in the Wild (1995) where he discusses the origins of formation of DCog into a framework for HCI.
Hutchins went on to found the Distributed Cognition and HCI Lab and research group at UC San Diego.
He currently still a professor at UC San Diego.</p>

<div class="theory-column" id="activity-theory">

        <div id="activity-theory-overview" class="theory-section overview">
		<h1>Activity Theory</h1>
		
		<p>Activity theory is a theoretical perspective that originated in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. In the early 1990s, it was proposed as a foundational theory for guiding HCI research beyond cognitive science. Like many post-cognitivist theories, activity theory breaks from the cognitivist assumption that cognition occurs solely inside the brain and holds that this is best understood as occurring in the activities of people. Leading advocates of this theory believe its primary value is in orienting designers and researchers and helping them ask the right questions.</p>

		<h2>Central Tenets</h2>	
		<ul>
			<li>Analyzes psychology in terms of activities, which are understood as organized hierarchically – activities composed of actions which are composed of operators.</li>
			<li>Object-oriented – the world is made up of objects, which have both natural and socio-cultural properties</li>
			<li>Tool mediation – tools and human behavior are mutually transformative</li>
			<li>Developmental perspective – understanding the developmental history of a practice is regarded as important for a complete picture</li>
			<li>Internalization/Externalization – the human mind is irreducibly social, and development can be understood as external activities transforming into internal mental activities</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Highly descriptive language for analyzing systems</li>
			<li>Describes different levels of agency for humans and non-humans</li>
			<li>While highly descriptive, not very prescriptive for systems design</li>
			<li>High barrier to learning the theory before applying it</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Problems</h2>

				<p>Apple Data Detectors is a technology invented at Apple’s Advanced Technology Group in the mid-90s and was a feature of Mac OS 8 and is currently present in iOS 3.0+ and OS X 10.5+. This technology detects structured data in text files – phone numbers, addresses, appointments, email addresses, URLs, ship tracking numbers, etc. – and allows users to import that data in a structured form into other applications like a browser, calendar, address book and so on. In an article for Interactions, Kaptelinin, Nardi and Macaulay describe the application of the activity checklist to this project.</p>

<p>Since the checklist encourages designers to choose the most relevant factors to apply to a given project, they selected the Learning/Cognition/Articulation and Development sections. These two categories of factors asks designers to attend to factors of the system like “Components of target actions that are to be internalized”, “Time and effort necessary to learn how to use existing technology” and “Use of tools at various stages of target action life-cycle”. This guided the design of the system to support end-user programming, providing a means for users to develop from simple use of technology to more sophisticated building it themselves.</p>

<p>In the Means/Ends categories, the designers found that user goals require more complex detectors, like the ability to import complete addresses rather than just city and country names.</p>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

<p><strong>The Activity Checklist</strong> consists of a set of 37 factors that activity theory regards as important for understanding the “contextual design space” of a given technological system that researchers would like to study. These factors are divided into four categories that correspond to aspects of the theory: Means/Ends, which contains factors related to the hierarchical structure of activity and asks questions about how the system supports user goals; Environment, including factors related to object-orientedness, and looks at different aspects of the users environment beyond the system itself; Learning/Cognition/Articulation, which refers to the principle of internalization/externalization and the aspects of the system that support this aspect; and Development, which considers temporal changes in the system and the previous three categories. These factors have two variations: an evaluation version which is intended as a tool for evaluating existing technologies; and a design version, which is intended to be used by designers for a system they are preparing to build or are in the early stages of building.</p>

<p>In addition to these factors, the checklist includes a preamble which summarizes the principles underlying the categories, and sample questions that provide a guide for mapping the factors to aspects of the system that’s being investigated.</p>

		<h1>Semiotics</h1>

		<p>Semiotic engineering began as an approach for designing the language of user interfaces and was rooted in research conducted in the 1980s by Brazilian HCI researchers. In 2005, de Souza published The Semiotic Engineering of Human-Computer Interaction outlining a complete semiotic approach to HCI. Semiotics is the study of signs and signification, so this theory views technological products as forms of communication which are interpreted by users.</p>

		<h2>Central Tenets </h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Interfaces are a medium of communication between interlocuters</li>
		<li>The principle interlocuters in a computer system are users and designers</li>
		<li>Communication occurs at the time of interaction</li>
		<li>The computer system functions as the designer’s deputy</li>
		<li>There is unlimited semiosis in that the meaning of signifiers to evolve and change continuously</li>
		<li>Interaction is a form of metacommunication, being communication from designers about the way users can communicate to the system</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Accounts for the designer and their relationship to the user</li>
		<li>Incorporates social and cultural influences in the meaning making process</li>
		<li>Minimally prescriptive in guiding system dsign, mainly descriptive</li>
		<li>Not widely accepted in guiding HCI research</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In Semiotic Engineering Methods, De Souza provides a case study of the application of SIM to
Audacity, a popular open-source digital audio processing application.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Preparation phase, the researchers identified the intended users by
investigating materials presented on the Audacity web site, determining their interests and level
of sophistication. This information was used to produce an inspection scenario – a narrative
describing a fictional motivation and tasks that are used to contextualize the inspection. In
this case, the scenario describes a set of tasks related to creating a cell phone ring tone and
recording the user’s voice.</p>

<p>The first step of SIM is analysis of metalinguistic signs, which includes the web site, software
start-up welcome message, and various types of documentation. Based on analysis at this level,
she found inconsistent messages addressed to users – some text assumed they were computer
illiterate, but familiar with digital audio processing concepts, and other text assumed the reverse.</p>

<p>The second step is the analysis of static signs – elements of the interface which remain
constant while it is being used. De Souza inferred what designers assumed who the users of
Audacity are, and their needs and wants, and found that designers were consistent in believing
users preferred direct manipulation interfaces. In the third step of the analysis, she notes
several inconsistencies at the level of dynamic signs such as how Import and Open commands
behave the same, but Save and Export behave differently.</p>

<p>In the remaining steps, De Souza combines the three levels of analysis and finds that the
interface reveals important insights into the organization of the development team, and also
notes a lack of consistency across all the levels. The analysis concludes by taking the concrete
observations found in the analysis segment and showing how they illustrate important aspects
of the semiotic theory of HCI.</p>

		<h1>Semiotics</h1>
		<h2>Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Semiotic Inspection Method</strong> is a formalized approach to inspecting user interfaces aimed
at producing valid knowledge rather than opinions. It is focused on the metacommunication
intended by designers and expressed by the interface. SIM consists of five steps preceded
by preparation by identifying the research question, the users and the top-level goals of the
system. The first three steps are iterative and deconstructive, breaking down the design
message into three classes of signs: metalinguistic signs, which is language that describes
signs that operate the system, including documentation, error and help messages, tips, etc.;
static signs which encompass fixed elements of the interface; and dynamic signs, those whose
meanings develop over time. The fourth step is collate and compare, where the classes of signs
are evaluated for consistency and completeness, and the fifth step involves evaluating the
effects of the observations made in step four on the communicability of the system.</p>

<p><strong>Communicability Evaluation Method</strong> is a way to evaluate the way designers’
metacommunication is received by users. This has some similarities to usability testing, but is
focused on the consistency and coherence of the communication which may be poor even if the
task is successful. There are three steps to CEM: tagging, the phase where the researcher tags
utterances by users while they are using a system of 13 possible tags; interpretation, where the
researcher analyzes the tags to discover frequency, patterns, grade and cause of problems; and semiotic profile, in which the researcher summarizes and characterizes the metacommunication</p>

		<h1>Social Psychology</h1>
		

		<p>Social psychology is a sub-field of psychology which studies the effect of social interactions on group and individual behavior. While not native to HCI, social psychology has been widely applied to the field, especially in the study of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). Rather than being a single, unified theory like activity theory or distributed cognition, social psychology refers to a group of loosely tied theories which make observations and predictions about group behavior.</p>

		<h2>Central Tenets</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>People are influenced by those around them</li>
		<li>The Input-Process-Output Model states that inputs of personnel, tasks and tools are processed by a group using patterns, roles and strategy which causes production, meets member needs, and maintains group cohesion</li>
		<li>Process losses occur which are output losses due to  mis-coordination or motivation losses</li>
		<li>Social loafing occurs when output consequences are diluted among team members</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Has a rich history dating back over a century that can be applied to current problems in HCI</li>
		<li>Researchers can apply its findings in a number of frameworks since it does not require adherence to an overarching theory</li>
		<li>Does not provide an overarching guiding theory for HCI</li>
		<li>With many intervening social factors, it can be hard to predict what interventions will be successful</li>
		</ul>
